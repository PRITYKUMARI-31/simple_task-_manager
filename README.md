# Task Management Application
### The project is a Task Management Application designed to simplify task organization and prioritize core features with a clean, user-friendly interface. The application provides users with a straightforward way to manage their daily tasks, track upcoming deadlines, and organize their workload by priority.

## Core Features:

### Dashboard:
Upon opening the app, users access a dashboard displaying all tasks in an organized layout.
It includes three main sections:
 Upcoming Tasks: Lists tasks with due dates approaching soon.
 Overdue Tasks: Highlights tasks that have missed their deadlines.
 Completed Tasks: Displays tasks that have been marked as finished.

### Task Management:

Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, enabling a flexible workflow.
Each task entry includes essential fields:
Title: Short name or identifier for the task.
Description: Detailed information about the task.
Due Date: Deadline for the task.
Priority Level: Categorized as High, Medium, or Low, allowing users to manage task urgency effectively.

### Priority Levels:
The application offers three priority levels (High, Medium, Low) to help users focus on urgent tasks.
Users can set or update priority levels for each task.

### Search and Filter:
A search feature allows users to locate tasks quickly based on keywords in the title or description.
Users can also filter tasks by:
Priority (High, Medium, Low)
Completion Status (e.g., All, Completed, Pending)

## Tech Stack:
#### Frontend:
React or Vanilla JavaScript (for a lightweight, responsive frontend interface)
CSS for basic styling to ensure a clean and visually accessible UI.
#### Storage:
Local Storage: Tasks are stored locally using the browserâ€™s localStorage or sessionStorage, making the application accessible offline and ensuring data persistence between sessions.

## Future Enhancements:

User Authentication: Implement user login functionality to allow personalized task management across devices.
Cloud Storage and Syncing: Integrate cloud storage options (e.g., Firebase) to sync tasks across multiple devices and allow data backup.
Recurring Tasks: Add support for recurring tasks to automatically reset deadlines for weekly or monthly tasks.
Notifications and Reminders: Set up notification features to remind users of approaching deadlines or overdue tasks.
